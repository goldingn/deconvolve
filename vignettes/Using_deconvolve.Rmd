## Why deconvolution?

Traditional methods for calculation of lignocellulosic biomass involve wet chemistry methods that are both costly and involve potentially harmful chemicals. While thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) does not provide exact measurements of carbon components, it can be used to estimate mass fractions of dominant carbon forms. The following is a brief introduction to how to use measurements from TGA to estimate pseudo-components using the deconvolve package. This methodology has been tested on a range of plant litter, whose carbon content is expected to roughly partition into three dominant types: hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. It is not suitable for woody material that may be dominated by a carbon form not modelled in this code.

Map of outputs of deconvolution of thermogravimetric curves: mass loss against temperature reflects the raw data we typically export from the TGA processing software (a.), derivative thermogravimetric rate against temperature (b.), and finally, the main output from this package, the deconvolved derivative thermogravimetric curves of each pseudo-component (c.).*"}

## Theory
using mixture model to estimate proportions of components, 
why fs? -- studies have found that it estimates well. good tie. flexible because has 4 parameters per curve. 

$\frac{d\alpha}{dT} = h\ exp\bigg\{-\frac{ln2}{s^2}\Big[ln\Big(1 + 2s \frac{T- p}{w}\Big)\Big]^2\bigg\}$
```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyAppFile('shiny-app/single_fs/app.R')
```

$\frac{d\alpha}{dT}_{total} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^3 \frac{d\alpha}{dT}_{i}$
```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}

## deconvolve

Depending how your data is structured when it is exported from the TGA analysis software, you may need to do some processing before it is ready for analysis. For example, the machine I use spits out data that has 10-20 lines of information at the top of the csv file as well as column names with characters R does not recognize. We can fix these types of issues with base R functions. In order to best use `deconvolve`, we want to make sure our data is in a classic data frame format with two important inputs: the temperature column and the mass loss column (mg). Let's take a look at the sample dataset included with `deconvolve`. 

``` {r}
data(juncus)
head(juncus)
```

Here we can see that the juncus dataset contains temperature, in this case in Celsius, as well as mass loss. 

## Using `deconvolve` for DTG deconvolution

The deconvolve package is set up to be as simple as possible, so there's only one function: `deconvolve()`. This function requires the data frame, the name of the temperature column, the name of the mass loss column, the initial mass of your sample, as well as a few optional inputs. The function defaults to temperature in Kelvin, but we can specify degrees Celsius by adding temp_type = 'C'. Here I am sticking with the default lower and upper bounds of 400 and 900, we could also change them by specifying them directly. We can also specify our own starting values if the default ones do not perform well. We will see an example of this later on. 

```{r}
output <- deconvolve(juncus, 'temp_C', 'mass_loss', 18.96, temp_type = 'C')
output
```

### data output
As we can see from the print summary, the output object is a list of four key outputs that we will use to understand our data. `$data` allows us to access our modified data frame. The deconvolve function has added several columns to it. This is provided so that you can play with the data yourself if you'd like.

```{r}
head(output$data)
```

### bounds output
This shows us again the bounds we placed on our data, a helpful way to check what we included, or importantly, excluded.

```{r}
output$bounds
```

### minpack.lm model output
This is the guts of our deconvolution. This presents the main output of the Fraser-Suzuki mixture model. We can see the 12 estimated parameter values. As a recap, 'h' indicates curve height, 's', curve skew, 'p' curve position', and 'w' curve width. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 refer to P-Hemicellulose, P-Cellulose, and P-Lignin, respectively. 

```{r}
output$minpack.lm_object
```

### mass fractions output
If you are using the package to calculate mass fraction of the three pseudo-components, this is your main output of interest. This output lists the mass fraction for each.

```{r}
output$mass_fractions
```

<hr>

## Visualising your outputs
There are two in-built options for plotting the deconvolution data. The default `plot()` function of your output object will produce the following

```{r}
plot(output)
```

Take a look at your plot. Do the estimates seem reasonable? In many cases, the peak of P-HC occurs at the lowest temperature, followed by P-CL and finally P-LG. If your plot doesn't follow this pattern, can you think of an ecological explanation given your species/plant material type? 

If you want to take a look at your raw mass loss curve and DTG curves, you can do so by: 

```{r}
plot(output, 'raw')
```

We can see that it has plotted both the mass loss against temperature and the derivative curve. The difference here is that the derivative curve places DTG on the y axis, displaying a change in rate. Every curve will look a little different, but you should see a few humps in your DTG curve. These correspond to the underlying mass loss curves of the three pseudo-components.
